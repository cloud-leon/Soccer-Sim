## üìã Overview

This R script simulates a simplified 90-minute soccer match between two teams using randomized player actions and probability-based outcomes. It models ball movement, possession changes, passing, shooting, and scoring in a sector-based virtual field.

---

## ‚öΩ Simulation Design

- The pitch is divided into **4 sectors**, with players distributed across them.
- Each team has players assigned to specific sectors, which impact scoring and possession battles.
- The game begins with a **coin toss** to determine initial possession and ball sector.
- The ball moves based on successful **passes** and **shots**.
- Each minute of play is simulated with randomized outcomes based on:
  - Offensive and defensive player "scores"
  - Probability of long shots, offsides, and successful goalie passes
- Scores are updated in real time, and match results are printed at the end.

## üîÅ Core Functions

- `start()`: Initializes the match with a coin toss and sets possession and position.
- `updatePlayer()`: Randomly selects a player in possession from the current sector.
- `scoreCalc(players)`: Generates a performance score based on involved players.
- `pass(team)`: Simulates a pass based on offensive vs defensive strength.
- `shot(minute, score)`: Simulates a shot on goal and updates the score if successful.
- `longShot(minute)`: Attempts a long-distance shot.
- `goalie()`: Determines how a goalie distributes the ball on possession start.
- `round(minute)`: Main engine of the match that runs every game minute.

## üß† Probabilities

- `pLongShot`: 30% chance a long shot is taken.
- `pOffsides`: 15% chance of an offside when in attacking sector.
- `pGoalieTo2`: 60% chance the goalie passes to the next sector instead of a long clearance.

---

## üìà Output

The simulation prints out key events such as:

- Coin toss results  
- Shot attempts and goals  
- Changes in possession  
- Offsides and interceptions  
- Final score and match outcome

## ‚úÖ How to Run

This script is written in **R Markdown** and outputs an **HTML document**. To run:

1. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Click `Knit` to generate the simulation output as an HTML report.
3. Review the printed play-by-play in the resulting document.

## üìù Notes

- The game is purely probabilistic and for educational/demo purposes.
- Player numbers and performance are simplified for simulation logic.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to extend the logic with more complexity (e.g. substitutions, fouls, cards, or player stamina).
